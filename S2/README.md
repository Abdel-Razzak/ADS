* #### Assignment: Titanic Data Set
For this assignment you will be working with the [Titanic Data Set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). This is a very famous data set and very often is a student's first step in machine learning! 

you will be trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased by using python this time. you need to do some additional cleaning in able to use the kaggle data in your learning model.

after your finish upload your work in the notebook format into your github account
