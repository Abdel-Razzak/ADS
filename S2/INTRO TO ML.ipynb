    "## Supervised Learning\n",
    "* Supervised learning algorithms are trained usinglabeled examples, such as an **input where the desired output is known.**\n",
    "* For example, a piece of equipment could have data points labeled either “F” (failed) or “R” (runs).\n",
    "* **The learning algorithm receives a set of inputs along with the corresponding correct outputs, and the algorithm learns by comparing its actual output with correct outputs to find errors.**\n",
    "* It then modifies the model accordingly.\n",
    "* Through methods like **classification, regression, prediction and gradient boosting, supervised learning uses patterns to predict the values of the label on additional unlabeled data.**\n",
    "* **Supervised learning is commonly used in applications where historical data predicts likely future events.**\n",
    "* For example, it can anticipate when **credit card transactions are likely to be fraudulent** or **which insurance customer is likely to file a claim.**\n",
    "* Or it can attempt to **predict the price of a house based on different features for houses for which we have historical price data.**"

    "* **The goal is to explore the data and find some structure within.**\n",
    "* **Or it can find the main attributes that separate customer segments from each other.**\n",
    "* Popular techniques include **self-organizing maps**, **nearestneighbor mapping**, **k-means clustering and singular value decomposition**.\n",

    "## Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "* Reinforcement learning is often used for robotics, gaming and navigation.\n",
    "* With reinforcement learning, **the algorithm discovers through trial and error which actions yield the greatest rewards.**\n",
    "* This type of learning has three primary components: **the agent (the learner or decision maker)**, **the environment (everything the agent interacts with)** and **actions (what theagent can do).**\n",
    "* The objective is for the agent to choose actions that maximize the expected reward over a given amount oftime.\n",
    "* The agent will reach the goal much faster by following agood policy.\n",
    "* So the goal in reinforcement learning is to learn the best policy."
