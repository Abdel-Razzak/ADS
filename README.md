# Introduction To Capstone Data Project 1: ANNU Statics Records
In this project we will be learning how do we combine everything we learn about your R and Python programming skills and your data visualization, data engineering (dataframe operations) and apply machine learning methods in order to solve a historical data problem.and in this case we will explore a local data taken from civil engineering department at An-Najah National University (ANNU) 

By working in this project you will need to be able to do the following:
* Read excel data statics record 
* Apply data clearning methods to filter and manipulate given data
* Apply EDA methods in python or R
* Extract important features to be used in machine learning models by using feature analysis methods
* Create model to predict final grade of students
* Create model to predict which lecturer taught this student
* Create model to classify students by department
You need to submit final project in the jupyter notebook format and upload it to you github account.
make sure that you explain your work properly and integrate it to your notebook file.

**Good Luck**
