# Applied Data Science Workshop (ADS)
A comprehensive 8-day training program for hands-on introduction to big data, data science, and machine learning models, methods and algorithms.

The workshop will take participants through the conceptual and applied foundations of the subject. Topics covered include:
* Data Science techniques, models, methods and best practices.
* Machine Learning theory, types of learning, and models
* Practical examples of applying most frequently used Machine Learning industry models

Labs are developed to practically learn how to use the R and Python programming languages and packages for applying the main concepts and techniques of data science and machine learning.

The Workshop will provide participants with an applied introduction to data science industry practices and models of machine learning. The workshop has a strong focus on gaining hands-on experience implementing algorithms and building predictive models on real datasets. By the end of the workshop, participants will be ready to implement the machine learning algorithms using data science on their own data, and immediately generate business value.
